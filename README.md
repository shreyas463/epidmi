Agent-Based Modeling (ABM):​

Utilizing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) allows us to represent individuals as agents, each with specific characteristics and behaviors.​ ABM is particularly effective in capturing the heterogeneity and interactions among individuals in a population.​

Repast Simphony:​

Repast Simphony serves as a powerful platform for implementing ABM and conducting simulations.​
It provides a flexible and customizable environment for modeling complex systems, making it well-suited for studying disease spread dynamics.​


Motivation:

The SI (Susceptible-Infected) and SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological models are essential for understanding infectious disease spread. The SI model, which focuses on susceptible and infected individuals, is useful for diseases that do not confer immunity post-infection. In contrast, the SIR model includes a recovered category, suitable for diseases were recovery grants immunity. Simulating these models helps predict outbreak trajectories, evaluate intervention impacts, and guide public health decisions. This is vital for efficient healthcare resource planning and reducing the societal impact of diseases.​
